TicTacToe
=========

This project is developed to practice test driven development in a MVC design based tic tac toe game. The game is developed in C++ in QT. You will need to have QT Creator installed in your system. The game is developed in Ubuntu, but can be built for winodws easily as there is no OS specific APIs used.

Vale. OK
